# P.IXC "Treasure Hunt" Application Specification

This document provides specifications and guidelines for using the P.IXC "Treasure Hunt" application.

## A. How to Use the Application

The P.IXC "Treasure Hunt" application is a tool used to track tasks as part of ITU-T P.IXC exercises. Below are the steps to operate the application:

1. **Setup by Test Manager:**
   - Enter a unique Test ID and select the CSV spec file by clicking "launch".

2. **Handover to Test User:**
   - Pass the device to the test user.

3. **Starting the Test:**
   - The test user clicks "Start" when ready. The first clue and a textbox for entering the code will be displayed.

4. **Solving Clues:**
   - The test user should find the code corresponding to each clue and enter it, then press Enter.
   - If the entered code is correct, the next clue will be displayed.
   - If the entered code is incorrect, an error message will appear.

5. **Completion:**
   - Upon finishing the last clue, a message will indicate "Test completed successfully".
   - The test user should then return the device to the test manager.

6. **Restarting the Test:**
   - Click "Launch new test" to begin the process anew for a different user or session.

7. **Cancellation of Test:**
   - The test can be canceled at any time by clicking the "Cancel Test" button.

## B. Specification Files (Spec Files)

Spec files are CSV formatted files used to store the clues and corresponding codes for the "Treasure Hunt" test.

- **Location:** Stored in the `specs` directory.
- **Extension:** `.csv`.

### Columns in Spec Files:

1. **Clue Description:** A detailed description of the clue provided to the test user.
2. **Correct Code:** The code that the test user must discover and enter to progress to the next clue.

## C. Log Files

Log files are generated by the application to record the activities of the test session.

### Columns in Log Files:

1. **Timestamp:** The date and time at which the log entry was created, typically in ISO 8601 format.
2. **Internal ID:** A unique identifier generated for each test session.
3. **Test ID:** The identifier entered at the beginning of the test to uniquely identify the test session.
4. **Line Number:** The current line number from the spec file being processed.
5. **Event Type:** The type of event being logged (e.g., "start", "correct", "error", "cancel", "end").
6. **Event Arguments:** Additional information about the event (e.g., the code entered by the user).

Please ensure that the CSV files are formatted correctly, following the standard CSV structure with comma-separated values and appropriate line breaks.

For any further details or custom configurations needed, refer to the main `README.md` of the repository or contact the repository maintainers.
